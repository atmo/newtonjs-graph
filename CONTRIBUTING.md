## Code Contributions

Because the project has an existing strong test suite and continuous integration, there already a pre-defined high standard. Therefore **please read through all the sections below carefully for highest success of your contribution being accepted.**

### Create a Fork

To get started, fork this repository. Please make your changes in your fork in **a feature branch**, ideally beginning with `feat/*`

To setup the project, all you need to do is run

```
npm install
npm run demo:dev
```

For more commands and how to setup the project on your local machine, see the [README.md](./README.md)

#### Use Feature Branches - plural

Large Pull Requests can be a challenge to merge. Consider separating changes are you would into smaller bits like features and create separate pull requests for each.

### Code Quality and Tests üëå

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/7a3975197c576202fe08/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/julie-ng/newtonjs-graph/maintainability)
[![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/7a3975197c576202fe08/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/julie-ng/newtonjs-graph/test_coverage)

Ensure you have tests and pass code qaulity checks. As of November 2019, the CI pipeline checks the following:

- Linting ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/))
- Tests ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/))
- Build Library
- Build Demo

To see if your code would pass all these checks in the CI build, just run:

```
npm run preflight
```

If it passes on your local machine, it _should_ be green in the CI build.

### Tests

Please write tests for your code. As of November 2019, the project has 88% code coverage.

## Styleguides

- #### JavaScript Styleguide, Linting
	Please be aware the Linting rules are very opinionated (esp. regarding semicolons).

	Do not change the `.eslintrc` file. Your pull request will be rejected. If you want to change the rules, please open a GitHub issue and we'll discuss it.

- #### Documentation Styleguide (JSDoc)
	This library uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for auto generated API documentation. Please document any code changes you make using JSDoc so we can continue to auto-generate the [API docs](https://julie-ng.github.io/newtonjs-graph/) so people can use this project.

	If you do not include JSDoc syntax, your pull request may be rejected.

- #### Git "Conventional Commit" Messages
	Please write commit messages per the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), using prefixes like `docs:`, `feat:` or `fix:` in your git commit messages to help autogenerate the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

- #### Git "Conventional Commit" Messages  
	Please write commit messages per the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), using prefixes like `docs:`, `feat:` or `fix:` in your git commit messages to help autogenerate the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Create a Pull Request

‚ö†Ô∏è Only Pull Requests with passing builds can be accepted for merging

When you are ready and checked you have met all code requirements described above, you can open a pull request.	When you do so, a CI build should be automatically started.

If you're having difficulty, please feel free to reach out for help by [opening an issue]((https://github.com/julie-ng/newtonjs-graph/issues)) or via Twitter [@jng5](https://twitter.com/jng5).
